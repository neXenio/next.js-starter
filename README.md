# neXenio Next.js Playground

This playground is intended for the use in trial working days. If you are the applicant, please make sure to setup the repository before the interview:
- check that you have an up-to-date and stable version of Node.js/npm installed
- run `npm install` in the repository
- make sure that `npm run dev` successfully starts the app
- visit `http://localhost:3000` and ensure that the app renders without issues

We recommend VisualStudio Code for the trial working day. However, if you feel more comfortable in a different IDE, you are welcome to use that instead.

Looking forward! ðŸ¤“
